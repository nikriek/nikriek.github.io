Today, more than 1 billion people in low- and middle-income countries lack access to basic healthcare. Predominant out-of- pocket payments lead to medical impoverishment. In turn, the uncertainty of a regular income leads to high absentee rates among healthcare professionals. Furthermore, healthcare sponsors (i.e. donors, governments and patients' families) are faced with intransparent payment processes including informal payments and outright "leakage" of funds resulting in an estimated loss of 40-60% of total direct healthcare investment in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, the United Nations included financial risk protection in healthcare among the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals).
